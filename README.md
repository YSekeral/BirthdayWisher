# BirthdayWisher
It's a simple yet thoughtful program that sends birthday emails to your loved ones â€” automatically!

ðŸ“Œ How it works:
- Add their info to a CSV file (name, email, birthday)
- Run the program
- Enter your Gmail App Password
âœ… The script checks dates and sends a birthday email using one of 3 randomized templates.

Technologies: Python, smtplib, datetime, pandas

I built this to automate something personal and meaningful â€” and along the way, I learned a lot about email protocols, automation, and CSV handling in Python.

Would love your feedback! ðŸ™Œ
